## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nsvoriginals/pocketswap.git
   cd pocketswap

2.Install packages :
     
     
     npm install


3.Run the application 
     
    
     npm run dev



## Next Steps

Once you have successfully installed and run the project, here are a few suggestions for next steps to further improve or contribute to the project:

### 1. **Explore the Code**
   - Dive into the backend and frontend code to understand how the different parts of the application communicate with each other.
   - Review how JWT authentication is handled in the backend to secure user data.
   - Investigate how state management is done using **Jotai** in the frontend.

### 2. **Enhance User Interface**
   - Customize the **Tailwind CSS** styles or integrate other UI frameworks to improve the design or create a new theme for the application.
   - Add features like payment history, detailed account views, or even dark mode.

### 3. **Implement New Features**
   - **Multiple Users Support**: Add the functionality to simulate payments between multiple users.
   - **Transaction History**: Build a page that shows transaction history with details about each transaction.
   - **Security Improvements**: Explore adding features like two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.

### 4. **Add Unit and Integration Tests**
   - Consider writing tests for both the frontend and backend using tools like **Jest** or **Cypress** to ensure your application remains robust and bug-free as you make changes.

### 5. **Deploy the Application**
   - Deploy the application to a platform like **Vercel** for the frontend and **Heroku** or **Render** for the backend.
   - Set up continuous deployment (CD) so that every change you push to the repository is automatically deployed to production.

### 6. **Documentation**
   - Consider expanding the documentation to include setup instructions for deploying the app, API documentation, or user guides to enhance usability.

### 7. **Contribute**
   - If you're interested in helping improve **Pocketswap**, contribute by opening issues or submitting pull requests with enhancements, bug fixes, or features.
   - Ensure that your contributions follow the coding standards and that the code is well-tested and documented.
